                    <p>Walking in to NSS day one I was both nervous and excited. This was the start of a year long course and I had so many things running through my mind. Thoughts like "Am I ready for this?", "Will I be able to balance this everything?","I wish I had more time to really understand everything in the prework". These are things I had thought before and talked about with others when deciding to sign up for NSS. Day one it felt like every doubtful thought I had about this program came back. Having done the prework and the Jumpstart course, I felt I had prepared for this but there were stil doubts racing through my mind.</p>  
                    <p>On day one, after hearing John Wark, the founder speak, along with our lead instructor, Zoe Ames, speak I felt more at ease. They helped me to remember that this is a journey, and all journeys are made up of steps. Every day on this journey will be a step, and that these small steps I am taking will allow me to cover a great distance. When I left day one, I felt excited and ready to begin.</p>
                    <p>During the first couple of days of class, we went through html and css. Most of the code was review from the prework. The really fascinating part of these classes was to see how our instructor Zoe broke down the layout of an existing web page and recreated it. This provided great insight on how to think like a developer and break things down. Walking through this was very beneficial. After going through this and the prework I feel like CSS can still be challenging at times since there are so many styling options and ways to style a site. This is something I hope to continue to work on and learn as I get more experience working with CSS.</p> 
                    <p>The next days of class we went over the command line, GIT, and GitHub. The command line is something I have seen before but never worked with until the prework. I find this an interesting tool and have been surprised by all the various commands that can be done. It feels pretty new now and somewhat old fashioned at the same time (like working on a computer in the 80s). I am making an effort to use that as much as I can to become more and more familiar with it. 
                    <p>I had heard of GIT and GitHub prior to the class and prework but had never seen how the version control software worked. I learned that GIT was the most widely used version control system. Seeing this software in action was really interesting and working in quality control currently I understand the importance of version control.</p>
                    <p>The process for merging branches in the GIT software was a bit difficult to understand at first. However with more explanation and practice this has started to make sense.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks in, I feel really happy with what I'm doing and where I am heading. I realize that there will be difficult times ahead and there will be plenty of mistakes/lessons learned that I will have to go through. I am really excited about the journey ahead.</p>
